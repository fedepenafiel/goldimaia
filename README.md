This file contains a visualization of Angel Di Maria's goal against Brazil on the final match of Copa America 2021. It shows the movement with and without the ball of the players involved.  
The idea is to show in a single picture, without movement and with as little information as possible, the movements that generated the iconic goal.

The xG value (expected goal value) is the probability that a shot will produce a goal based on the characteristics of that shot and the events that preceded it. Some of these characteristics/variables include:

Player location: How far was he from the goal and at what angle on the pitch?
Body part: Was it a header or the player's foot?
Type of pass: Was it a long pass, a cross, a set piece, etc.?
Type of attack: Was it from established possession? Was it a rebound? Did the defense have time to get into position? Was there a dribble?
Each shot is compared to thousands of shots with similar characteristics to determine the probability that it will result in a goal. That probability is the total expected goals.
